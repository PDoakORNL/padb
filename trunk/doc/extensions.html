<h2>MPI collective debugger extension proposal</h2>

<div class=mode>
 <a name=overview></a>
 <h3>Overview</h3>
</div>
The current 
<a href="http://www.mcs.anl.gov/research/projects/mpi/mpi-debug/">MPI debugger interface</a>
is used to export information from a running application to a debugger.  The current
interface allow the debugger to look at a MPI Process, to iterate over communicators
within that process and to view message queues associated with a communicator.

<p>
I propose an extension to this to export information about individual communicators
within a process, in particular information about collective operations (MPI_Bcast,
MPI_Reduce et. al.)

<h2>Implementation</h2>
The specific information I propose is to add a communicator specific counter for
each possible collective where the counter simply records the number of times the 
collective has been called on this communicator.  Along with this is keeping a second piece
of data, that of if the process is still performing the collective operation.

<p>

A new enum is added to the interface, <i>mqs_comm_class</i> with values for each collective
call.

<p>

A single extra callback function <i>mqs_get_comm_coll_state</i> is added to the
interface and queries the current communicator in the same way as <i>mqs_next_operation</i>.
This function takes the standard <i>process</i> parameter, a <i>mqs_comm_class</i> enum as input
for which collective to query and two <i>int *</i>, the first of these is a pointer to a
int set which should be set to the count of the number of calls to the collective, the second
is a pointer to a int which should be set zero or one depending if the collective operation is still
active.

<p>

A successful call to the <i>mqs_get_comm_coll_state</i> should return <i>mqs_ok</i> with 
<i>mqs_no_information</i> being used in the case where information isn't available.  This allows
further enum values to be added in the future should the mpi-forum approve new collective 
functions without needing to change the debugger function interface.

<h3>Performance Impact</h3>
Maintaining this data does add code to the "critical path" of the MPI stack, in
it's simplest form all it requires is a pair of counter increments per collective call,
one on function entry and one on function exit so whilst there is a non-zero run-time cost
associated with maintaining this information it's a minimal one.

<h2>mpi_interface.h</h2>
The additions required to mpi_interface.h are shown below.
<pre>

typedef enum
{
  mqs_comm_barrier,
  mqs_comm_broadcast,
  mqs_comm_allgather,
  mqs_comm_allgatherv,
  mqs_comm_allreduce,
  mqs_comm_alltoall,
  mqs_comm_alltoallv,
  mqs_comm_reduce_scatter,
  mqs_comm_reduce,
  mqs_comm_gather,
  mqs_comm_gatherv,
  mqs_comm_scan,
  mqs_comm_scatter,
  mqs_comm_scatterv
} mqs_comm_class;

/***********************************************************************
 * Collective extension
 *
 * This extension should be considered optional and the debugger should
 * correctly the case where it doesn't exist.
 *
 */

/*
 * Return the state of collective operations for the currently active
 * communicator, that is the number of times the collective has been
 * called and if the operation is still in progress.
 * 
 * The first int is *really* mqs_comm_class.
 */
extern int mqs_get_comm_coll_state (mqs_process *, int, int *, int *);
</pre>

<h2>Benefits</h2>
The extension allows a debugger or external program to know the state of collective
calls with the parallel program.  In the typical scenario of debugging a hung
application this knowledge allows the debugger and programmer to know instantly 
which processes are stuck in collective calls and which aren't, either because they 
have successful made the collective call and returned or because they haven't
made the calls other ranks in a communicator have.  This information allows swift
identification of problem areas within the job where further investigation may be 
required.

<p>
This extension was originally developed in early 2007 whilst I was working at
Quadrics and has proved it's value numerous times in real-life cases.

 <h2>Sample Implementation</h2>
</div>
At this time a sample implementation is available for OpenMPI only although work 
is being done a MPICH2 version.
