<h1>Padb: A parallel debugging tool</h1>

<h2>About</h2>
<i>Padb</i> is a tool for examining and debugging parallel programs,
originally developed at <a href=http://www.quadrics.com/>Quadrics</a>
it's now maintained externally and supports a wide range of parallel
environments.  It's an open source, non-interactive, command line,
scriptable tool intended for use by programmers and system
administrators alike.

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Stack trace generation</li>
<li>MPI Message queue display</li>
<li>Deadlock detection</li>
<li>Process interrogation</li>
<li>Signal forwarding</li>
<li>MPI collective reporting</li>
</ul>

<h2>What padb isn't</h2>
<i>Padb</i> is a job inspection tool, it can tell you want you want
to know about your job and your MPI stack, it however will not tell
you about your cluster as a whole and it won't diagnose problems
with your wider environment, including you job launcher.  <i>Padb</i>
does not and will not launch or wrap your jobs for you, it is not a
job harness.

<h2>Licence</h2>
<i>padb</i> is licenced under the LGPL and as such is open-source.

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<i>Padb</i> requires very little support from the OS or parallel
environment to run, it's main use is to assist in the debugging of
parallel applications, it's assumed that you have a working MPI
stack and that "Hello world" application runs to completion without
error.<br>  A </i>Linux</i> operating system is assumed and a working
<i>gdb</i> is required for stack trace functionality.<br>
At the time of writing a shared filesystem between all nodes in the
parallel job is required if using orte (Open-MPI runtime).

<h2>Parallel Environments</h2>
<i>Padb</i> works and is supported on the following parallel
environments and MPI stacks.  Not all features are available on all
runtimes.
<ul>
<li><a href=http://www.quadrics.com/>Quadrics RMS</a></li>
Runs natively on clusters running RMS.
<li><a href=http://computing.llnl.gov/linux/slurm>Slurm</a></li>
Runs natively on clusters running Slurm irrespective of the runtime used.
<li><a href=http://www.open-mpi.org/>Open MPI</a></li>
Supports orted or OMPI jobs run under slurm.
<li><a href=http://www.mcs.anl.gov/mpi/mpich/>MPICH2</a></li>
Supports mpd or MPICH2 jobs run under slurm.
</ul>

<h2>Mailing Lists</h2>
<a href=http://pittman.org.uk/mailman/listinfo>Mailing lists</a>
for padb discussion and development are available for public use.
<ul>
<li><a href=http://pittman.org.uk/pipermail/padb-devel_pittman.org.uk/>padb-devel</a> archives.</li>

</ul>


<h2>Patches</h2>
The advanced Group Deadlock Detection algorithm within <i>padb</i>
requires modifications to the MPI library to function properly.
At this time patches are available for Open MPI v1.3 and svn trunk
only, contact <a href="mailto:padb-devel@pittman.org.uk">padb-devel@pittman.org.uk</a> for updates.

<h2>Download</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href=downloads/padb>Version 2.2</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Source Code</h2>
Public subversion access to <i>padb</i> is in the pipeline but
is not available yet.

<h2>Building</h2>
<i>Padb</i> is written in perl and can be run immediately after
downloading.  Some functionality however requires binaries to be
built on the target system.  To build these download the tarball
and run <i>make</i> followed by <i>make install</i>.
