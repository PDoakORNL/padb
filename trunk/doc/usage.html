 <h2>Selecting the Resource Manager (Job Launcher)</h2>
</div>
<i>Padb</i> supports many resource managers and should select the
appropriate one for your machine, if you have more than one resource
manager installed or <i>padb</i> can't detect the correct one use
the <b>rmgr</b> <a href=configuration.html>configuration option</a> to
set machine-wide defaults.

<p>If your resource manager or scheduler is not supported you can also
use <b>local</b> and process identifiers (pids) will be used instead
of job ids.

<p>The <b>--list-rmgrs</b> option can be used to show a list of
detected resource managers and their active jobs.

 <h2>Selecting the job(s) to target</h2>
</div>
<i>Padb</i> provides several ways for the user to select which jobs to
target depending on requirements.  All jobs detected by padb are
identified by a unique numeric "jobid", typically this maps directly
only a identifier provided by the underlying resource manager.  The
default is to target jobs of the current user, this can be over-ridden
with the <b>--user</b> flag.

<h2>To target a specific job</h2> To target a specific job specify the
numeric jobid for the job on the command line, after all other
options.

<h3>Showing list of current jobs</h3>
To show a list of currently running jobs for a given user use the
<b>--show-jobs</b> option.  Alternatively the <b>--list-rmgrs</b>
option shows a list of detected resource managers along with a list of
currently active jobs for each of them.

<h3>To target all jobs</h3> To target all jobs currently running for a
given user use the <b>--all</b> (<b>-a</b>) flag.

<h3>To target any jobs</h3> To target any job currently running for a
given user use the <b>--any</b> (<b>-A</b>) flag.  This differs from
targeting all jobs as it will exit with an error if more than one job
is running.

<h1><a name="rank">Selecting ranks (Processes)</a></h1> In modes where
data for each process is reported separately it is possible to
restrict which ranks are queried, this is done via the <b>--rank</b>
option.  Multiple ranks can be selected by specifying <b>--rank</b>
multiple times or by specifying a rank list using
the <b>[&lt;low&gt;-&lt;high&gt;,&lt;value&gt;]</b> notation.  Eg, to specify ranks
0,2 and 3 use <b>--rank [0,2-3]</b>

<hr>

<h1>Selecting which mode to run in.</h1>
<i>Padb</i> can present an array of different information about your
select jobs and it can present it in a number of different ways.  With
the exception of <a href="full-report.html">full Report</a> only one
mode can be selected, if you need more information about the program
<i>padb</i> has to be run more than once.  A list of available modes
and their descriptions can be found on
the <a href="modes.html">modes</a> page.
