Building:

Padb itself is a perl script and does not require any building
however some functionality uses helper programs which do.  To build
these programs enter the following commands:

cd src
make


Installing:

Padb needs to be available on all nodes where it is expected to run,
this can either be achieved by installing to a shared directory
or installing to every node in your cluster.  In addition a optional 
configuration file can be installed to any node where the padb command
might be executed.  To install on a cluster run the following commands:

cd src
sudo make install
sudo make config_install
